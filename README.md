# myPortfolio
## Student of SMU Coding Bootcamp portfolio
Hello, this project contains the beginning of my portfolio. It exemplifies what I have learned so far in my SMU bootcamp class as of 6/29/2021. It is made up mostly of HTML, JavaScript and CSS. This is my first step in embarking on my journey to achieve my goal of becoming a Full Stack Developer.

## Project development process

I have taken the old page and placed it in the bin. With the learnings on Bootstrap, I have used their album template to begin my portfolio as it appeared to be clean and great start for me. I took out the pre-work examples and have added all of my homeworks since they incorporate much higher level organizations and skills learned so far. By using Bootstrap styles and js, I was able to add some more mobile responsive features.
