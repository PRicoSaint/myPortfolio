# myPortfolio
## Student of SMU Coding Bootcamp portfolio
Hello, this project contains the beginning of my portfolio. It exemplifies what I have learned so far in my SMU bootcamp class as of 8/26/2021. It is made up mostly of HTML, JavaScript and CSS. This is my first step in embarking on my journey to achieve my goal of becoming a Full Stack Developer. 

As the semester has progressed, so has my number of projects. I have now been able to work in the back end, working in Node.js. I have taken it all the way to a full stack application deployed on Heroku. Please see the portfolio for a couple of examples.

## Project development process

The page has been updated with more examples from newer projects on top. This includes a second collaborative project under the S.W.O.R.D. project name.
