    <p>
        My name is Esteban Santos. My goal is to become a Full stack Developer. 
        I want to be a part of the whole process of web development. My interests include tabletop miniature games, 
        painting and building miniatures, building computers, and playing RPGâ€™s, both on the computer and pen & paper variants. 
        I also am a believer in balance so I workout as consistently as I can. I have one son and am happily married to a beautiful 
        wife whose name is Irma. In the future, we hope to have one more child.
    </p>
    <p>
        My previous experience is in the manufacturing sector, specifically the food industry. I was a maintenance engineer 
        and supervisor. I have led teams of maintenance mechanics in the repair and improvement of many different types of 
        equipment. I have worked for Pepsi, Hormel and General Mills, seeing how many different products are manufactured. 
        It was a great experience but I have decided that I want to explore a career more focused in a field closer to my 
        degree, Electrical Engineering. I took coding classes back in college, mainly in MATlab and Assembly language. 
        I remember both fondly and wish to refresh my very dusty skills and take them to the next level.
