<h1 id="aboutme">About me</h1>
 <p>
    My name is Esteban Santos. My goal is to become a Full stack Developer. 
    I want to be a part of the whole process of web development. My interests include tabletop miniature games, 
    painting and building miniatures, building computers, playing RPGâ€™s both computer and pen and paper. 
    I also am a believer in balance so I workout as much as I can. I have one son and am happily married. 
    We hope to have one more child.
</p>
<p>
    My previous experience is in the manufacturing sector, specifically the food industry. I was a maintenance engineer 
    and supervisor. I have led teams of maintenance mechanics in the repair and improvement of many different types of 
    equipment. I have worked for Pepsi, Hormel and General Mills, seeing how their products are manufactured. 
    It was a great experience but I have decided that I want to explore a career more focused in a field closer to my 
    degree, Electrical Engineering.
